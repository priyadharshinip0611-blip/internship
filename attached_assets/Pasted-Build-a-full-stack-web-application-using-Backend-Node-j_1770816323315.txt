Build a full-stack web application using:

Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB (use Mongoose)
Authentication: JWT
Password Hashing: bcrypt
Frontend: Basic HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS (no React)
Structure it cleanly (MVC pattern).

Project Title:
Farmer-to-Retailer Trading Platform – Week 1 (DB & User Management Only)

====================================
WEEK 1 REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT)
====================================

This week we are ONLY building:

1. Database Schema
2. Secure Login System
3. User Roles (Admin, Farmer, Retailer)
4. Profile Creation
5. Farmer Approval System
6. Field Validation

Do NOT build product listing or payments yet.

====================================
ROLES
====================================

There are 3 roles:

1. ADMIN
   - Can login only (no public registration)
   - Can approve/reject farmers
   - Can view all users

2. FARMER
   - Can register
   - Must be approved by admin before login works
   - Has profile fields:
        name
        email
        password
        phone
        farmName
        location
        isApproved (default false)

3. RETAILER
   - Can register
   - Can login directly (no approval needed)
   - Has profile fields:
        name
        email
        password
        phone
        shopName
        location

====================================
DATABASE MODELS
====================================

Create a User model with:

- name (required)
- email (required, unique)
- password (hashed)
- role (enum: admin, farmer, retailer)
- phone (required)
- location (required)
- farmName (only for farmer)
- shopName (only for retailer)
- isApproved (default false, only for farmers)
- createdAt

====================================
AUTHENTICATION
====================================

- Use bcrypt to hash passwords
- Use JWT for authentication
- Protect routes with middleware
- Prevent farmer login if isApproved = false
- Admin account should be created manually when server starts:
    email: admin@platform.com
    password: admin123

====================================
ROUTES
====================================

POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
GET /api/admin/users
PUT /api/admin/approve/:id

====================================
VALIDATION
====================================

- Email format validation
- Password minimum 6 characters
- Required fields check
- Prevent duplicate emails

====================================
FRONTEND PAGES
====================================

Create simple frontend:

1. index.html (Login Page)
2. register.html (Choose Farmer or Retailer)
3. dashboard.html (Different view for each role)
4. admin.html (Approve farmers)

Use fetch() to call backend APIs.

====================================
SECURITY
====================================

- Store JWT in localStorage
- Use Authorization header
- Middleware to verify role
- Hide admin routes from non-admin

====================================
WEEK 1 OUTPUT EXPECTATION
====================================

When complete, I should be able to:

1. Register as Farmer
2. Register as Retailer
3. Login as Admin
4. Approve Farmer
5. Login as Approved Farmer
6. Login as Retailer

====================================
CODE STRUCTURE
====================================

/models
/routes
/middleware
/controllers
/server.js

Keep code clean and commented.

After generating, explain how to run the project in Replit.
